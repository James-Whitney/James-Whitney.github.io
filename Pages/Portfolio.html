									<p>In Fall of 2014, I started at California Polytechnic State University (San Luis Obispo, CA). I was awarded my Bachelor’s of Science in Computer Engineering in June of 2018.</p>
									<p>During my time at Cal Poly I had to opportunity to meet many amazing people and explore different aspects of engineering.  I worked with the Mixed Reality Research group on campus throughout my senior year as part of my senior project as well as to help supply tools and education students on emerging augmented and virtual reality technologies.  Through the group I got to attend Nvidia’s GTC and learn first hand from industry professionals about techniques used in modern parallel computing.  I also got to become the group’s lab manager, putting to use my long history of building computers to put together the labs new computers and maintaining our on-campus lab.</p>

										<h1>Gluster</h1>
										<h3>Accepted to the <a href="http://cmmse.usal.es/cmmse2018/">2018 CMMSE Conference</a></h3>
										<h3>Accepted to the <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11227">Journal of Supercomputing</a></h3>
									</header>

									<ul>
										<li>Distributed Computing</li>
										<li>Concurrent Programming</li>
										<li>Golang Library</li>
									</ul>

									<p>Gluster is a project that came out of a graduate course in distributed computing I was taking along with Chandler Gifford with whom I worked to develop Gluster as a distributed computing Golang library to allow a user to easily specify cluster members and distribute programs across the them with minimal lines of code. The implementation attempts to mimic the style of common multithreading libraries so that distributing a program across a cluster is just as simple as multithreading. The final draft was submitted to the journal on Sept. 19th, 2018.</p>

									<h3>Abstract</h3>

									<blockquote><b>In the last decade the majority of new Central Processing Units (CPU) have become multicore. To take advantage of these new architectures we need programming languages that can express parallelisms. The programming language Golang is well known for providing developers with an easy programming model for Communicating Sequential Process (CSP)-style concurrency enabling programmers to easily write functions that will execute on the different cores of a modern multicore CPUs.  Unfortunately, Golang does not support distributed execution of <i>goroutines</i> on clusters or distributed systems. In this paper, we extend the concurrency capabilities of Golang to a distributed cluster by providing a library called Gluster, that is simple and easy to use. We developed a programming model that allows users to easily distribute work between machines, in a similar way as workloads are distributed in multicore CPUs by using operating system threads with libraries similar to Pthreads and OpenMP. Our Gluster solution is based on a single master node that connects to peers over a network and distributes work to these peers. The master node is able to send function arguments over the network to worker nodes as well as receive return values. Results using matrix multiplication show that our distributed implementation can speed up the <i>goroutines</i> by 5x in a small 16 nodes cluster but more importantly, it shows that the results are scalable to cluster size.</b></blockquote>

									</header>

									<ul>
										<li>Dynamic Time Warping</li>
										<li>Real-time Signal Processing</li>
										<li>Recurrent Neural Networks (Tensorflow)</li>
									</ul>

									<p>My senior project at Cal Poly was working with Professor Christian Eckhardt on a research project with Cal Poly’s <a href="http://mixedrealitylab.io/">Mixed Reality Lab</a> to determine if inexpensive <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10264">flex sensors</a> can be used to detect and identify hand motions when they are adhered to the arm of a user. My research in this endeavor involved trying many machine learning techniques to identify gestures, from recurrent neural networks to dynamic time warping.</p>

									<h3>Abstract</h3>

									<blockquote><b>Flex sensors are cheap sensors capable of detecting small movements through changes in its resistance. Here I present the results of my research to determine if when adhered to the forearm, flex sensors can be used for real time gesture recognition. The motivation for real time operations comes from the desire to use these sensors for mixed reality applications. The finding of my research is that flex sensors can be used for this application through the utilization of dynamic time warping and signal processing, the design described in this paper is capable of recognizing all of the gestures supported by the comparable Myo Armband and can easily be adapted to additional custom gestures.</b></blockquote>

										<a href=""></a>
										<p>Working as the team lead with four other students over the course of eight weeks, I lead my team to design and implemented a real-time game engine from scratch.  We named the engine “Voyager” after the name of the relatively simple game we developed on top of the engine for demonstration purposes.  My contribution to the engine was the integration of the <a href="https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3">Bullet3</a> physics engine into the project, as well as the development of the player interactions with the ship and turrets for the game demo.</p>

										<p>My Capstone team of five students was approached by <a href="https://www.sandia.gov/">Sandia National Labs</a> with the request of developing a project of our own interest that utilized their <a href="http://minimega.org/">Minimega</a> tool so that they could get feedback on its usability from the perspective of undergraduate students.  Minimega is a tool for spawning and managing large quantities of virtual machine or containers along with virtual routers and switches to allow users to model real-world computer networks.</p>
										<p>Our team used minimega to simulate a custom Ethereum network of miners and simulated transaction traffic occurring on the network.  My contribution was the integration of <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/geth">Geth</a> to our containers and the automation of blockchain creation, mining, and the simulation of transactions on the network.</p>

										<p>As the final project for a microcontrollers course using a Texas Instruments <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/MSP-EXP432P401R">MSP432</a> development board I made a device that allows a user to power a standard outlet based on a temperature reading.  The intended use case for this device is to allow a user to set the water temperature in a slow-cooker to a specific target, allowing them to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sous-vide">sous-vide</a> cook food.  The device takes readings from a waterproof temperature sensor place inside the slow-cooker and switches the power to a solid-state relay that powers an outlet (that the slow-cooker is plugged into).  The regulated temperature can be controlled with a set of buttons and the current and set temperatures are both displayed on a seven-segment display.</p>

										<p>As the final project for my 3D computer graphics course I was tasked with creating an interesting interactive program that utilized 3D computer graphics.  I ambitiously chose to attempt to implement portal mechanics as seen in games series like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)">Portal</a>.  My goal was to create a portal class (C++) that could be placed in any direction, angle, or allowed to move without breaking smooth visual continuity.  This is actually quite different from the traditional portal games which require 45-degree alignments and prevents portals from moving in the environment, which I discovered during this project was done intentionally as designing algorithms that are able to position virtual cameras for dynamic portal locations are quite complex.  A write-up made for the project can be found <a href="portals_writeup.html">here</a> that also includes the entire assembly program.</p>

										<p>After implementing the RAT CPU (an in-house RISC architecture developed by faculty at Cal Poly) over eight weeks in VHDL and deployed on a <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/">Basys 3 FPGA</a> board, my partner and I where tasked with creating an interactive and visual program built in RAT assembly.  Our project was a version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders">Space Invaders</a> complete with sprites, firing mechanics, and a score counter.  The program was mostly interrupt driven from keyboard controls and worked closely with a provided VGA controller (also implemented in VHDL).
