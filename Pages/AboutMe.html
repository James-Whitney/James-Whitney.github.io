								<h2>Northwest Native</h2>
								<p>I grew up in Bellevue, Washington, where I fell in love with the rain and mountain.  From a young age I was engrossed with computers and video games, my parents hoping my hobbies would lead to a career sent me <a href="https://www.digipen.edu/">Digipen</a> summer camps, which exposed me at an early age to programming and game development.  In middle school my parents caved and got me my own laptop, so I’d spend less time hogging the family computer grinding levels in Runescape.  From there my interest in computers started to take hold, I’ve always been active in trying build communities with friends around the games that we play, In the sixth grade, for fun I designed and launched a simple website for my clan of friends.  In my eighth grade I got into hosting game and VoIP servers.  I enjoyed the technical aspect of server management always installing mods, tools, and web UIs that far outweighed the needs of our small community servers over the years.  In High school I had greater control over my academic career, which I used to push myself into taking as many advanced placement courses as I could.  It was around this time I discovered my obsession with learning new things especially in the sciences, which was a strong influence in me becoming an engineer.</p>
								<h2>New Graduate from Cal Poly!</h2>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/grad_photo.jpg" alt="" /></span>In 2014 I entered Cal Poly as a General Engineering Major (we declare on application),  and used the flexibility of the major to explore different aspects of engineering over the course of my first two years.  From hand drafting of mechanical parts to PCB layout I dipped my hands into as many departments as I could before settling on computer engineering.  Computer engineering at Cal Poly sits right between both electrical engineering and computer science, offering the best of both worlds as students within the major have access to the course catalog of both departments.  This was perfect for me with my long-cultivated interest in computers and programing, combined with the extensive physics and math curriculums of the electrical engineering department and the hands-on aspects of the labs.  Despite only officially changing into the major at the beginning of my Junior year, my early explorations into electrical and computer science classes I enabled me to graduate in four years with a <a href="file:///C:/Users/James/Git/James-Whitney.github.io/pages/Portfolio.html#papers">publication</a> to boot.</p>
								<p>During my final year at Cal Poly, a detour in computer graphics technical electives got me involved with Cal Poly’s computer graphics research group.  Where I became the first manager of the new campus Mixed Reality Lab.  The lab served to give students access to emerging virtual reality and augmented reality devices and the computers to run them.  Over the course of my final year I got heavily involved with the group going on trips to conferences and as part of my <a href="file:///C:/Users/James/Git/James-Whitney.github.io/pages/Portfolio.html#seniorproject">senior project</a> with Christian Eckhardt, the group’s faculty supervisor.  A big part of what I did at the lab educating students on the current state of technologies and giving them hands-on experience with state-of-the-art hardware.</p>
								<h2>What I do for fun!</h2>
								<p>Despite being done with school for now, I’ll never be done learning.  Learning new things has always been one of the biggest joys in my life, so I’m often listening to online lectures and podcasts especially when I’m running or going on hikes.  I see myself as a vacuum for knowledge, while I do follow the latest advancements in computer hardware, machine learning, and computer graphics, I also really enjoy learning new things outside my discipline like Biology, Architecture, and Psychology.</p>
								<p>In my spare time I enjoy experimenting with my home server and Raspberry Pis which acts as an experimental platform for my tinkering with different operating systems, networking configurations, container setups, home automation tools, and self-hosted cloud services.  My server is also home to many community game servers I run.  Playing video and board games with friends is one of my favorite pastimes.  I play a lot of games, typically of the building/simulation genre, but my all-time favorite game is Minecraft, with a bunch of mods. I always have an expert mode modpack running on my server at home that I return to when I need a break from the world.</p>
